## 💡 Included Flows

| Flow | Description |
|------|--------------|
| 🚀 **Flow – Intelligent Power BI Insights & Stakeholder Notifier** | A real-time communication engine that instantly delivers refreshed **Sales Data + Full Media Source Performance** across all digital, offline, and econometric touchpoints. This flow unifies **ad and social data, TV / OOH publisher reports, Google Trends, Econometrics (BigQuery APIs), Competitor Activity (subscription APIs), Email attachments, and Forecasting data** — consolidating it all into Power BI and automatically notifying **clients, performance teams, and account managers** in **Microsoft Teams**. Teams receive actionable insights and optimisation prompts for **budget reallocation, stress testing, and reinvestment** within minutes of refresh. |
| ⚡ **Flow – Continuous Power BI Auto-Refresh & Transparency Engine** | A game-changing orchestration flow ensuring **Power BI datasets refresh in perfect sync** with the latest data ingestions. Scheduled for early morning execution, it guarantees **marketing and client teams see accurate dashboards the moment their day starts** — providing immediate confidence, saving hours of manual checks, and reinforcing transparency. This automation ensures data freshness aligns with every ingestion cycle, delivering truly **always-on analytics**. |
| 📩 **Flow – Autonomous Daily Insight Email & Forecast Delivery** | A next-level automation that crafts and distributes **data-driven daily summaries and forecast insights** directly from Power BI. It transforms raw data into **concise, actionable investment optimisation plans** for the coming day/week — eliminating the need to chase publisher reports or manually reconcile performance. Teams receive **smart summaries highlighting emerging trends, channel synergies, and funnel opportunities**, shifting focus from report gathering to strategic action. |
| 🌐 **Flow – Dynamic SFTP URL Data Ingestion & Validation Pipeline** | A breakthrough automation that resolves a long-standing integration gap — when publisher or platform auto-emails only contain **secure URLs instead of attachments**. This flow dynamically retrieves those files, **downloads, validates, and securely transmits them** via SFTP Gateway into cloud infrastructure. It ensures seamless continuity across data sources, overcoming one of the most complex ingestion challenges in digital operations. |
| 🧩 **Flow – Autonomous MS Forms Data Capture & Pipeline Integrator** | A fully autonomous ingestion solution that instantly processes **MS Forms file submissions**, validating and transferring them through the SFTP Gateway to the analytics environment — **zero human involvement**. This automation eliminates delays and errors, seamlessly embedding ad-hoc submissions into the live data ecosystem and enriching reports and forecasts with real-time precision. |
